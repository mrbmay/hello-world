Hello! I'm a God-fearing married man and proud father of three, driven by faith, family, and a passion for growth. After spending over 16 years in the workforce, I'm now stepping into the tech world with the goal of securing a strong future for my loved ones. I enjoy learning new things, watching sports, and cheering on my favorite teams—the Washington Commanders and the Boston Celtics—but most of all, I love the Cardinals. I often attend home games across all sports, soaking in the energy and excitement of each season. I'm excited to see where this new journey takes me and grateful for the opportunity to build something meaningful.
